## PROJECT 1: [Patient Reported Satisfaction Dashboard (HCAHPS) ](https://github.com/sarahkpree/Patient_Satisfaction/tree/main)

The Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey is a standardized survey used to measure patients' perspectives on the quality of care they received in the hospital. The survey encompasses various aspects of the patient experience, including communication with nurses and doctors, cleanliness and quietness of the hospital environment, pain management, discharge information, and overall rating of the hospital. The goal of this project was to create a Tableau dashboard that compares patient safisfaction across hospitals in the United States to examine healthcare quality, identify areas for improvement, and improve transparency.

## PROJECT 2: [Employee Wellness Analysis & Work Absenteeism Dashboard](https://github.com/sarahkpree/Absenteeism_At_Work/tree/main)

The project focused on conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on employee data to uncover insights into absenteeism patterns and employee well-being. By addressing specific questions, the analysis aimed to understand various factors influencing absenteeism and identify potential correlations within the dataset. The analysis revealed that 111 employees meet specific health criteria and are entitled to a bonus totaling $100,000, with each eligible employee receiving approximately $900. Additionally, efforts to incentivize a smoke-free workplace environment have been initiated, with 686 non-smoking employees identified and a budget allocation of $983,221 designated for hourly wage increases. Furthermore, while certain factors such as education level and age correlate with absenteeism rates, other factors like commute distance and tenure do not exhibit significant relationships.

## PROJECT 3: [Emergency Room Dashboard](https://github.com/sarahkpree/ER_Dashboard/tree/main)

This project involved creating an ER dashboard using simulated patient census data spanning 18 months, with nine visualizations including total patient encounters, gender breakdown, admission rates, average wait time and satisfaction scores over time, age group distribution, patient race breakdown, department referral distribution, and a heatmap of average wait time by day and time. This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of ER operations, enabling professionals to monitor patient flow, demographic trends, and service efficiency. Such insights are important for optimizing resource allocation, improving patient satisfaction, and improving quality of care.
