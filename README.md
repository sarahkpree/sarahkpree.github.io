### PROJECT 1: [TABLEAU DASHBOARD FOR PATIENT SATISFACTION SURVEY (HCAHPS) ANALYSIS ](https://github.com/sarahkpree/Patient_Satisfaction/tree/main)

The Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey is a standardized survey used to measure patients' perspectives on the quality of care they received in the hospital. The survey encompasses various aspects of the patient experience, including communication with nurses and doctors, cleanliness and quietness of the hospital environment, pain management, discharge information, and overall rating of the hospital. The goal of this project was to create a Tableau dashboard that compares patient safisfaction across hospitals in the United States to examine healthcare quality, identify areas for improvement, and improve transparency.

### PROJECT 2: [EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS OF ABSENTEEISM PATTERNS AND EMPLOYEE WELL-BEING](https://github.com/sarahkpree/Absenteeism_At_Work/tree/main)

The project focused on conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on employee data to uncover insights into absenteeism patterns and employee well-being. By addressing specific questions, the analysis aimed to understand various factors influencing absenteeism and identify potential correlations within the dataset. In addition, a PowerBI dashboard was created to further understand absenteeism at work.

The analysis revealed that 111 employees meet specific health criteria and are entitled to a bonus totaling $100,000, with each eligible employee receiving approximately $900. Additionally, efforts to incentivize a smoke-free workplace environment have been initiated, with 686 non-smoking employees identified and a budget allocation of $983,221 designated for hourly wage increases. Furthermore, while certain factors such as education level and age correlate with absenteeism rates, other factors like commute distance and tenure do not exhibit significant relationships.

### PROJECT 3: [TABLEAU DASHBOARD FOR EMEREGENCY ROOM](https://github.com/sarahkpree/ER_Dashboard/tree/main)

This project involved creating an ER dashboard using simulated patient census data spanning 18 months, with nine visualizations including total patient encounters, gender breakdown, admission rates, average wait time and satisfaction scores over time, age group distribution, patient race breakdown, department referral distribution, and a heatmap of average wait time by day and time. This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of ER operations, enabling professionals to monitor patient flow, demographic trends, and service efficiency. Such insights are important for optimizing resource allocation, improving patient satisfaction, and improving quality of care.

### PROJECT 4: [PATIENT WAITLIST INSIGHTS DASHBOARD](https://github.com/sarahkpree/Patient_Waitlist/tree/main)

The PowerBI dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the patient waitlist at the hospital, featuring various visualizations based on key criteria. These include a pie chart illustrating the distribution of case types (inpatient, outpatient, or day case), a stacked column chart showing wait times categorized by age group, and a list highlighting the top 5 specialties with the longest wait times. Additionally, line charts track the total cases over time, with separate lines for each case type and a specific line for outpatient cases. Users can filter the data by date, case type, and specialty to tailor their analysis.

## **Academic Projects**

### PROJECT 1: [IDENTIFYING KEY PREDICTORS FOR DIABETES DIAGNOSIS THROUGH SUPPOR VECTOR MACHINE](https://github.com/sarahkpree/Diabetes_Diagnosis)

This group project aimed to leverage machine learning techniques to identify key predictors for diagnosing diabetes. Through data cleaning, preprocessing, and the implementation of Support Vector Machine (SVM) with regularization, significant predictors such as glucose levels, the diabetes pedigree function, and BMI were identified. Despite challenges such as data imbalance and missing values, the project highlights the potential of machine learning in improving and predicting a diabetes diagnosis.

### PROJECT 2: [DOG BREED CLASSIFICATION USING CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS](https://github.com/sarahkpree/Dog_Breed_Identification)

The aim of this group project was to develop models capable of categorizing various dog breeds using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). With a dataset comprising of 120 images of dog breeds, we trained multiple models employing both handcrafted CNN architectures and transfer learning approaches. Keeping hyperparameters constant across all models during training, we found that transfer learning models consistently outperformed handcrafted CNN models on this dataset, with Xception achieving the highest accuracy rate of 80.5%. Additionally, we highlighted the significance of fine-tuning models, which greatly improves their performance. Furthermore, we examined and compared the GPU requirements and training times of different models, noting that transfer learning models, particularly ResNet50V2, required over 15 hours. Lastly, we also explored dog breeds that are easily distinguishable and those that are not.

### PROJECT 3: [A COMPREHENSIVE DATA ANALYSIS OF NETFLIX CONTENT](https://github.com/sarahkpree/Netflix_Analysis)

This final project entails a statistical analysis report using a public dataset from Kaggle.com containing information on over 15,000 titles on Netflix, including genre, language, rating, runtime, IMDb score, Rotten Tomatoes score, etc. Initially, I downloaded and processed the dataset in Excel, reducing it from 29 to 11 columns to simplify analysis. After importing the data into R, I conducted graphical and numerical analyses, including bar graphs for categorical data like genre and language, and histograms with calculations for numerical data such as IMDb score and Rotten Tomatoes score.
